## MLFlow Transformer Flavor

It enables logging of transformers models, components, and pipelines in MLflow format via the mlflow.transformers.save_model() and mlflow.transformers.log_model() functions.

MLflow supports the use of the Transformers package by providing:

Simplified Experiment Tracking: Efficient logging of parameters, metrics, and models during the fine-tuning process. \
Effortless Model Deployment: Streamlined deployment to various production environments. \
Library Integration: Integration with HuggingFace libraries like Accelerate, PEFT for model optimization. \
Prompt Management: Save prompt templates with transformers pipelines to optimize inference with less boilerplate.
