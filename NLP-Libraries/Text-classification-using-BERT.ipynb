Especially comedy spoofs. \"Airplane\", \"The Naked Gun\" trilogy, \"Blazing Saddles\", \"High Anxiety\", and \"Spaceballs\" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre. \"Pandemonium\" is not up there with those films. Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn\\'t all that funny. There are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that\\'s all this film has going for it. Geez, \"Scream\" had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film. How bizarre is that?<br /><br />*1/2 (out of four)'\n",

His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.\"\n",
